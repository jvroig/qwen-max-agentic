def get_tools_format():
    
    tools_format = """

When you want to use a tool, make a tool call (no explanations) using this exact format:

```
[[qwen-tool-start]]
{
    "name": "tool_name",
    "input": {
        "param1": "value1",
        "param2": "value2"
    }
}
[[qwen-tool-end]]
```

Note that the triple backticks (```) are part of the format!

Example 1:
************************
User: What is your current working directory?
Qwen-Max:
```
[[qwen-tool-start]]
{
    "name": "get_cwd",
    "input": ""
}
[[qwen-tool-end]]
```
**********************


Example 2:
************************
User: List the files in your current working directory.
Qwen-Max:
```
[[qwen-tool-start]]
{
    "name": "list_directory",
    "input": {
        "path": "."
    }
}
[[qwen-tool-end]]
```
**********************

Immediately end your response after calling a tool and the final triple backticks.

After receiving the results of a tool call, do not parrot everything back to the user.
Instead, just briefly summarize the results in 1-2 sentences.
